# `tatami` header files

`tatami` is a header-only library, so usage is as simple as copying this directory into your project's source code and adding `#include "tatami/tatami.h"`.

Parts of the codebase are written against the C++17 standard, though it would not be difficult to support earlier versions if people are interested. 

Certain extensions in the `extensions/` subdirectory may require additional configuration during compilation and linking.
