# A C++ API for all sorts of matrices 

## Overview

**tatami** is a spiritual successor to the [**beachmat** C++ API](https://github.com/LTLA/beachmat) that provides a C++ API into various matrix types:

- Dense row/column major matrices, with user-defined containers.
- Compressed sparse row/column matrices, with user-defined containers.
- Matrices generated by delayed operations, ~stolen~ inspired by those in [**DelayedArray**](https://github.com/Bioconductor/DelayedArray).

This enables C++ applications to flexibly handle a variety of different inputs with no changes to their code.

## TODO

- Add Roxygen documentation.
- Add tutorials.
- Add bindings for TileDB.
